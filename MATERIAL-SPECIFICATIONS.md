## Paper & Manuscripts

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 65-70°F
- Relative Humidity: 30-50%

**Sources:**
- Library of Congress - Care, Handling and Storage of Works on Paper
- NISO TR01 - Environmental Guidelines for the Storage of Paper Records
- Smithsonian Institution Archives

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: HIGH (acid formation accelerates with temperature)
- Mechanical Decay: VERY HIGH (paper fibers highly sensitive to RH changes)
- Mold Growth: HIGH
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
RH control is crucial - moisture provides the catalyst for chemical reactions within paper that lead to acid formation.

## Black & White Photographs

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 60-68°F (Extended-term storage: ≤64°F)
- Relative Humidity: 30-40%

**Sources:**
- Library of Congress - Information Leaflet on Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs
- NEDCC 5.3 - Care of Photographs
- NPS Conserve O Gram 14/10

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: HIGH
- Mechanical Decay: VERY HIGH (emulsions damaged by RH cycling)
- Mold Growth: HIGH
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
Highest recommended extended-term storage temperature for B&W prints and negatives on polyester film base is 64°F. Avoid RH cycling which damages photographic emulsions.

## Color Photographs & Film

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 35-40°F (Cold storage required)
- Relative Humidity: 30-40%

**Sources:**
- Library of Congress Photographic Materials
- Code of Federal Regulations - Film Storage Standards (35°F or below, 35% RH)
- IPI Cold Storage Guidelines

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: CRITICAL (chromogenic dyes fade rapidly at room temperature)
- Mechanical Decay: HIGH
- Mold Growth: MODERATE
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
Cold storage (≤40°F) required for extended preservation. Cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, and chromogenic dye photographs deteriorate rapidly at 64°F and require cold (35-40°F) or freezing conditions for extended-term storage. Above 65°F = high risk of rapid degradation.

## Textiles & Fabrics

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 65-70°F
- Relative Humidity: 45-55%

**Sources:**
- Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute - Climate and Textiles Storage
- Canadian Conservation Institute - Textiles and the Environment
- George Washington University Textile Museum

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: MODERATE
- Mechanical Decay: VERY HIGH (fibers expand/contract significantly with RH changes)
- Mold Growth: VERY HIGH (organic materials very susceptible)
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
Stability essential - temperature and humidity changes cause textile fibers to expand and contract, which over time causes damage and deterioration. Keep RH below 65% to prevent mold. Above 65% RH and lack of air circulation promote mold growth and insect infestation.

## Leather & Parchment

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 64-68°F
- Relative Humidity: 45-55%

**Sources:**
- NPS Appendix S - Curatorial Care of Objects Made From Leather and Skin Products
- Canadian Conservation Institute - Caring for Leather, Skin and Fur
- Museum Guidelines (Australia)

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: HIGH
- Mechanical Decay: CRITICAL (very sensitive to RH - cracks when low, rots when high)
- Mold Growth: VERY HIGH
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical RH Thresholds:**
- **Below 35% RH**: Causes drying, desiccation, shrinkage, and cracking
- **Above 65% RH**: Encourages mold growth and accelerates hydrolysis, leading to "red rot" (powdery, friable state)

**Critical Notes:**
Narrow safe RH range. Daily fluctuations should be limited to 4°C and 5% RH.

## Metal Objects (General)

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 60-68°F
- Relative Humidity: 30-50% (≤55% maximum)

**Sources:**
- Canadian Conservation Institute - Storage of Metals (CCI Notes 9/2)
- NPS Metal Objects Guide

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: LOW
- Mechanical Decay: LOW
- Mold Growth: LOW
- Metal Corrosion: CRITICAL

**Critical Notes:**
No corrosion should occur on most stable metal objects if RH is maintained at or below 55%. Dew point control essential to prevent condensation, which accelerates metal corrosion.

**Material-Specific Thresholds:**
- Steels and brass: stable below 15% RH
- Silver: 50% RH or below
- Uncontaminated iron: stable at 50% RH
- Contaminated iron: continues to corrode above 50% RH

---

## Sensitive Metals (Iron, Bronze)

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 60-68°F
- Relative Humidity: 12-35% (Very low)

**Sources:**
- Canadian Conservation Institute - Storage of Metals
- Museum Australia - Metals Collections

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: LOW
- Mechanical Decay: LOW
- Mold Growth: NONE (too dry for biological activity)
- Metal Corrosion: CRITICAL

**Critical RH Thresholds:**
- Iron is most stable at ≤12% RH
- Iron contaminated with salts: requires <35% RH to prevent continued corrosion
- All iron rusts when RH is over about 65%
- Actively corroding iron should be stored at RH below 10-15%

**Critical Notes:**
Very dry conditions required. Sensitive metals require much lower RH than general collections.

## Magnetic Tape & Audio

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 50-65°F (Permanent value: 46-50°F)
- Relative Humidity: 30-40%

**Sources:**
- Library of Congress - Care, Handling, and Storage of Audio Visual Materials
- NEDCC Session 6 - Storage and Handling of Media Collections
- CLIR - Magnetic Tape Storage and Handling Guide

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: VERY HIGH (binder hydrolysis)
- Mechanical Decay: HIGH
- Mold Growth: HIGH
- Metal Corrosion: MODERATE

**Storage Recommendations by Duration:**
- Materials to be preserved for minimum of 10 years: 65-70°F, 45-50% RH
- Materials having permanent value: 46-50°F, 30-40% RH
- Do not store magnetic tape below 46°F

**Critical Notes:**
Higher humidity (above 40%) causes binder hydrolysis or degradation of the binder. Humidity above 65% can lead to mold growth on magnetic media.

## Optical Media (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray)

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 64-70°F
- Relative Humidity: 30-50%

**Sources:**
- ISO 9660 Standard (18-23°C / 64-73°F, 30-50% RH)
- National Archives - Machine-Readable Media
- NEDCC Media Collections

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: HIGH
- Mechanical Decay: HIGH (thermal cycling damages disc layers)
- Mold Growth: MODERATE
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
Stability critical - avoid thermal cycling which causes physical stress and deterioration. Temperature and humidity should ideally not fluctuate. Above 65% RH can lead to mold growth on disc surface.

## Wood & Furniture

**Optimal Conditions:**
- Temperature: 65-70°F
- Relative Humidity: 45-55%

**Sources:**
- Canadian Conservation Institute
- General Museum Guidelines

**Risk Priorities:**
- Natural Aging: MODERATE
- Mechanical Decay: CRITICAL (wood swells/shrinks significantly with RH changes)
- Mold Growth: HIGH
- Metal Corrosion: LOW

**Critical Notes:**
Wood is highly hygroscopic - RH changes cause warping, cracking, and joint failure. Stability is essential. Dimensional changes occur rapidly with RH fluctuations.

## General Preservation Principles

### Temperature Effects
- Every 10°F increase doubles the rate of chemical reactions
- Lower temperatures slow natural aging for all materials
- Cold storage (≤40°F) required for color photographs

### Relative Humidity Effects
- **Too Low (<30%)**: Causes desiccation, brittleness, cracking
- **Too High (>65%)**: Promotes mold growth, accelerates chemical degradation
- **Fluctuations**: Cause dimensional changes, especially damaging to hygroscopic materials

### Mold Growth Thresholds
- Mold spores begin germinating above 65% RH
- Risk increases significantly at 70% RH combined with warm temperatures (70°F+)
- Organic materials (textiles, leather, paper) are most susceptible

### Metal Corrosion
- Primary factor: Relative humidity (keep ≤55% for most metals)
- Condensation at dew point accelerates corrosion dramatically
- Sensitive metals (iron) require very low RH (≤35%)

### Stability vs. Absolute Values
Modern preservation science emphasizes that **stability** is often more important than hitting exact target values. Fluctuations cause more damage than slightly elevated but stable conditions.
